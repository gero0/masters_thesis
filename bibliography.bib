  abstract = {By formalizing the relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness, fitness landscapes harbor information on molecular and evolutionary constraints. The shape of the fitness landscape determines the potential for adaptation and speciation, as well as our ability to predict evolution. Consequently, fitness landscape theory has been invoked across the natural sciences and across multiple levels of biological organization. We review here the existing literature on fitness landscape theory by describing the main types of fitness landscape models, and highlight how these are increasingly integrated into an applicable statistical framework for the study of evolution. Specifically, we demonstrate how the interpretation of experimental studies with respect to fitness landscape models enables a direct link between evolution, molecular biology, and systems biology.}

  abstract  = {Inherent networks of potential energy surfaces proposed in physical chemistry inspired a compact network characterization of combinatorial fitness landscapes. In these so-called Local Optima Networks (LON), the nodes correspond to the local optima and the edges quantify a measure of adjacency - transition probability between them.Methods so far used an exhaustive search for extracting LON, limiting their applicability to small problem instances only. To increase scalability, in this paper a new data-driven methodology is proposed that approximates the LON from actual runs of search methods. The method enables the extraction and study of LON corresponding to the various types of instances from the Quadratic Assignment Problem Library (QAPLIB), whose search spaces are characterized in terms of local minima connectivity. Our analysis provides a novel view of the unified testbed of QAP combinatorial landscapes used in the literature, revealing qualitative inherent properties that can be used to classify instances and estimate search difficulty.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               The traveling salesman problem, TSP for short, has model character in many branches of mathematics, computer science, and operations research. Heuristics, linear programming, and branch and bound, which are still the main components of today's most successful approaches to hard combinatorial optimization problems, were first formulated for the TSP and used to solve practical problem instances. When the theory of NP-completeness developed, the TSP was one of the first problems to be proven NP-hard by Karp in 1972. New algorithmic techniques have first been developed for or at least have been applied to the TSP to show their effectiveness. Examples are branch and bound, Lagrangean relaxation, Lin-Kernighan type methods, simulated annealing, and the field of polyhedral combinatorics for hard combinatorial optimization problems. The chapter presents a self-contained introduction into algorithmic and computational aspects of the traveling salesman problem along with their theoretical prerequisites as seen from the point of view of an operations researcher who wants to solve practical instances. The chapter provides guidelines to explain how to attack a TSP instance depending on its size, its structural properties (e.g., metric), the available computation time, and the desired quality of the solution.}

  abstract = { This paper presents a formulation of the quadratic assignment problem, of which the Koopmans-Beckmann formulation is a special case. Various applications for the formulation are discussed. The equivalence of the problem to a linear assignment problem with certain additional constraints is demonstrated. A method for calculating a lower bound on the cost function is presented, and this forms the basis for an algorithm to determine optimal solutions. Further generalizations to cubic, quartic, N-adic problems are considered. }
